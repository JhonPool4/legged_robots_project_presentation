	\begin{itemize}
		\item We perform  bipedal walking without a mathematical model and complex control formulation.
		%\item The algorithm learned to coordinate the movements of the robot's legs after 70 million iterations.
		\item The strange way of walking of the robot is related to the reward system that was established in this work.
		\item  Finally, it was observed that during training, the robot made movements that removed its center of mass from the support polygon.
		\item As work in the future, it will be considered to keep the center mass within the support polygon to increase the stability of the system, as well as the possibility of adding muscles to achieve natural movements.
